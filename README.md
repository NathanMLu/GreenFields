# Getting Started

This boiler plate web app uses a react frontend and a flask python back end. In order to get the web app fully running you need to install all dependencies. Install all the react dependencies by running the command `npm insall`. For the flask api, cd into the `/api` folder through your terminal and creat a virtual environment using `py -3 -m venv venv` or `$ . venv/bin/activate` on mac/linux. Once you have the virtual environment set up then you can run the python api file to get the flask rest api working using the command `python ./api.py`. Once you have followed all the steps above then you can run the app on the developement server using `npm start`
